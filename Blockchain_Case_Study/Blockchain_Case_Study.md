# Case Study Proposal: SECUREKEY

## What Is It

SecureKey is a leading identity and authentication provider that simplifies consumer access to online services and applications. SecureKey’s next generation privacy-enhancing services enable consumers to conveniently and privately assert identity information using trusted providers, such as banks, telcos and governments, helping them connect to critical online services with a digital credential they already have and trust, while ensuring that information is only ever shared with explicit user consent. SecureKey is a champion of the ecosystem approach to identity, revolutionizing the way consumers and organizations approach identity and attribute sharing in the digital age. SecureKey is headquartered in Toronto, with offices in Boston and San Francisco.

## Why This Matters

We live in a digital world, but are being forced to use outdated and broken identity systems, with too many avenues that welcome the possibility of fraud. Utilizing cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, and through collaboration with innovators like IBM and leaders like Canada’s major banks, SecureKey allows consumers to use trusted credential providers, such as financial institutions, telecom network operators and governments, to securely and privately authenticate with, and assert their identities for accessing, the services of participating organizations.

The SecureKey Concierge ServiceTM is recognized as one of the most successful federated authentication network initiatives in the world, with the total number of active users increasing substantially every year. Instead of remembering yet another username and password, the service allows consumers to sign-in to online destinations using a credential from a partner retail financial institution. The SecureKey Concierge Service currently serves the Government of Canada, Revenu Quebec and other Canadian market customers based upon its partnerships within the Canadian banking community, including: ATB Financial, Affinity Credit Union, BMO, Caisses populaires, CIBC, Desjardins, National Bank, RBC, Scotiabank, Tangerine, TD Bank, and UNI Financial Corporation. 

SecureKey and its trusted partners recently launched Verified.Me®, a new identity network designed to provide consumers with control of their digital identities, to help combat identity fraud and remove much of the friction consumers face today in trying to verify who they are to get things done either in person, online or on the phone.Using trusted sources to verify the three core elements of identity – “What I Know, What I Have and What I Am” – the new service puts privacy first while making it easier and more secure to open or access accounts and services, gain access to and update personal information, control who has access to records and when, and communicate and share information with trusted destinations and services - right from a smartphone. It’s safe, secure, and under the user’s control, and supported by a network of trusted organizations.

## Why This May be Interesting

Organizations such as the Digital ID Authentication Council of Canada, the Command Control and Interoperability Center for Advanced Data Analytics (CCICADA), and many of Canada’s leading financial institutions (BMO, CIBC, Desjardins, RBC, Scotiabank and TD) have been engaged as both investors and partners in the development of this digital identity ecosystem. This unique collaboration will ensure the effective delivery of the new innovation, and improved privacy, security and digital fraud protection for both consumers and service providers across Canada.
